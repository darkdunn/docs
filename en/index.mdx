## Prerequisites

Supernote’s plugin system is built on React Native. It’s recommended to be familiar with React Native fundamentals (components, state management, packaging and debugging). Reference: [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.79/getting-started).

Supernote devices run on Android. If your plugin needs Android capabilities (files, permissions, system services), basic Android development knowledge helps. Reference: [Android Docs](https://developer.android.com/).
