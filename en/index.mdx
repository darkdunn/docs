## Prerequisites

The Supernote plugin system is built on React Native. We recommend learning the basics of React Native first (components, state management, bundling, and debugging). See: [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.79/getting-started).

Supernote devices run on Android. If your plugin needs Android capabilities (e.g. files, permissions, or system services), it also helps to understand Android development basics. See:
[Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/).


## Fundamentals
