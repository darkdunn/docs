description: "Unified API return result."

APIs in `PluginCommAPI`, `PluginNoteAPI`, `PluginDocAPI`, and `PluginFileAPI` return `APIResponse<T>`.
The data structure is:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | `boolean` | Whether the API call succeeds |
| `result` | `T \| null` | Present only when `success === true`. When the call fails, `result` is `null`.<br />If `T` is `boolean`/`number`/`string`, `result` is the corresponding primitive value.<br />If `T` is a custom type, `result` is an instance of that type. |
| `error` | `{ code: number; message: string } \| null` | Present only when `success === false`. When the call succeeds, it is `null`.<br />`code` is the error code, and `message` is the error description. |
