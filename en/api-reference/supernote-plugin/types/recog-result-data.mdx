description: "Element recognition result data structure."
---

`RecogResultData` is typically returned as the `recognizeResult` field of [`Element`](/api-reference/supernote-plugin/types/trail). It describes the recognized category and key point location information.

## Purpose

You can treat this as a "recognition output summary", which typically includes:

- **Recognized category**: `predict_name` indicates which category the model/rules think the element belongs to (default: `others`).
- **Recognition region**: `up_left_point_*` and `down_right_point_*` form a bounding box that represents the region on the page.
- **Key point**: `key_point_*` is a representative anchor point used for later interactions or positioning.

<Note>
These fields use pixel coordinates, which makes them convenient for direct UI display and interaction positioning.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `predict_name` | `string` | Category name (default: `others`) |
| `up_left_point_x` | `number` | Top-left X (pixel coordinates) |
| `up_left_point_y` | `number` | Top-left Y (pixel coordinates) |
| `key_point_x` | `number` | Key point X (pixel coordinates) |
| `key_point_y` | `number` | Key point Y (pixel coordinates) |
| `down_right_point_x` | `number` | Bottom-right X (pixel coordinates) |
| `down_right_point_y` | `number` | Bottom-right Y (pixel coordinates) |
